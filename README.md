Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting rainfall based on historical weather data. Rainfall prediction is crucial for agricultural planning, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts the likelihood of rainfall based on various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. The project uses a dataset that includes weather data over a specific period.

# Project Description
Climate is an important aspect of human life.In this project we are trying to deal with the prediction of rainfall which is a major aspect of human life and which provides the major resource of human life that is Fresh Water.

Task (T) : To predict the rainfall in india

Experience (E) : Run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past rainfall patterns.

Performance Measure(P) : The percentage of accuracy predicted by the model.

# Dataset used in the model
Data Set - The current dataset is taken from Kaggle
